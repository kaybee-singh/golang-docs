# Golang Variables

Variables are used to store information temporarily to be referenced later in the program.

A variable can store integer, string kind of value.
## Storing info in a variable

A variable can store integars, strings etc kind of value. We can use following syntax to store information in the variable.

- In below example variable is declared with a name **firstname** and its type is string. When we create a variable by default it does not have any information and it is blank so in the second line we have assigned a value to the variable.

```javascript
var firstname string
firstname = "kay"
```

- In below example a variable is declared and a value is also assigned during decleration in the same line.

~~~
var firstname string = "kay"
~~~

- In below example a variable is decleared using the shorthand syntax, which means creating variable without using the var keyword.

~~~
firstname := "kay"
~~~
